### Additional Analyses

This document contains the full reports of additional analyses concerning achieved security and different usability measures (see Table 1).  
We found significant differences in all three usability measures between participants who submitted a secure solution for the two-factor authentication task and those who did not.  
There was also a significant difference between those two groups for the number of clicks in the password-storage task.
